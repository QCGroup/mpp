# Model Predictive Planning

This repository contains complete Python code to implement the Model Predictive Planning algorithm and reproduce all the figures in the associated paper:

> _Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft_<br/>
> by [Matthew T. Wallace](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XizTm5sAAAAJ), Brett Streetman, and [Laurent Lessard](https://laurentlessard.com/)<br/>
> IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2024

The jupyter notebook [generate_figures.ipynb](https://github.com/QCGroup/mpp/blob/main/generate_figures.ipynb) generates all the figures from the paper.

## Updates to be included shortly
